# The Clone
The Youtube clone is a fairly simple project. It showcases the framework of HTML and CSS. It was a fun project and I can't wait for my next adventure!

The project started out with building out the base design and struckering the vidoes. The videos themselves where all wrapped in their each individal div, and then each video was wrapped in one single div, the section element. 

The section then was converted into a CSS grid using columns with the 1fr.

After the videos where properly designed, the header and the sidebar(nav) needed to be designed. This process was used with Flexbox. Using key CSS properties like, "justy-content" and "align items".

Overall this project was amazing! And anyone who is newer to web developing should definitly give this a go and even try Facebook, or Twitter. Even Reddit!

# Features
With a front end website like this there isnt to many features but I managaged to sneak some nice ones in 🙇‍♂️

* Thumbnails with hyperlinks
  * All thumbnails are clickable and will direct you to the real Youtube Videos. Target=_blank was used on all links so a new tab is opened to keep the project in view
* Author Names with hyperlinks
* Tooltips for the most of the items on the header

# Future Features 
One thing I love about developing, is the ability to add new features in the future. Now these ideas may not be added but could be added and would definitly be a cool addition.

* Youtube Icon is a Hyperlink
* Clickable sidebar with hyperlinks
* Dynamic Videos imported with users own login from youtube!
  * This one might not be ideal but cool to practice the backend of things
